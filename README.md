# Gather-Starter Kit for Gitpod

An optimized **Gather** development environment based on **Phoenix Web Framework** which helps you to provision your Phoenix project as a **Gitpod** workspace in the cloud.

The  setup takes care about the installation of Erlang/Elxiir, Postgres and all the stuff you need to have some fun with Phoneix. The process is literally effortless and in 5 minutes you can start to code Elixir in your browser!  

### How-to:

1. Fork this repo
2. Spin up your gitpod workspace from the forked repo: 
  ```https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/*[your-username]*/gather-starter```
3. Follow the instructions in the CLI.
4. Enjoy! 

### What is this exactly? 

This setup is an automated version of the official Phoenix "Installation" and "Up and running" guides:  
- https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content
- https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html#content

Once the setup is done you can run and develop your Phonenix app(s) in your own Gitpod cloud IDE workspace.

### Start your Phoenix server

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
